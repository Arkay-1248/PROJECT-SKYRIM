Current Load Order: https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/project-skyrim-07-rev2

## DISCLAIMER

First, I am sorry, I cannot provide the whole changelog from 0.6 to 0.7, because I would be writing almost the whole list in a changelog, and that's too time consuming, and still wouldn't be accurate due to the data lost that I had to suffer while rebuilding the list to make 0.7, so I will be uploading a load order library and here will be the changelog of revision (alongside some notes of 0.7 overhaul that I still can share accurately).

0.7 - Overhaul comments.

# Performance and Graphics

The implementation of most thigns went great, these include:

- a whole overhaul  of graphics, literally, 90% of the visual mods either changed or were mixed in a different way
- weather changed, a PI-CHO ENB version was made for us on request
- nature, exteriors received a massive overhaul, including area, grass and plants, while keeping better performance when compared to older versions

What we didn't do:

- NPC BSA implementation: this didn't happen because the compatiblity is incredible hard to manage, some NPCS break and the player breaks (khajiit invisible body)


# Gameplay

This received a LOT of changes, and still is being worked on, Gale has been actively testing new setups of enemies overhauls to increase the variety (which might be one of the biggest varieties out there right now), both on humanoid NPCs and monsters. These is what went out great:

- Area Overhaul including NPC and enemy tweaks
- NSFW Integration, there is a litte bit more, some were cut in the revision.
- Fixed a lot of bugs due to gameplay, even more in revision.
- Precision bugs were fixed.
- Much more variety of perks and enemies.

What was cut from the initial idea:

- Unleveled: it limits the player too much, we are testing dynamic leveled zones, but in general, the leveled zones are great now being managed by OWL into a scaling, great and most importantly free world.

# Gear

Received a completely overhual, barely can connect to older versions, made by Luna's modlist mostly.

- There is a lot of new weapons, too much to count, good luck into trying to get them all, the variety and quality are in both extremely top tier spots.
- Armors were cut and remade into higher quality and more according to the theme, there are still skimpy outfits, but their integration was made more balanced.
- NPCs outfits were remade with that. 

TLDR: a lot of stuff were added seamlessly, enjoy

# Music

PROJECT Music has been done, it might receive changes later, but I reached a really good spot with it, it blends in great while having the gradient I wanted between nordic and soule.
